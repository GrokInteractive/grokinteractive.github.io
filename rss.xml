      <title>Happy Developers are Good Developers</title>
      <link>http://www.grok-interactive.com/blog/happy-developers-are-good-developers/</link>
      <description>Any developer can relate to writing depressing code. Our industry is known for long hours and the resulting burnout that follows. Corporate America is full of managers that like to see code written, without caring if the code will ever launch. This grinds on the inner-nerd of every developer and they suffer.</description>

      <title>Git Hooks for Checking Tabs vs Spaces</title>
      <link>http://www.grok-interactive.com/blog/githooks/</link>
      <description>While wars rage on about why to use spaces or tabs over the other, we are not here to talk about why we do not use tabs in a project. No, no, we are here to talk about *git hooks*.</description>

      <title>Save Me Not</title>
      <link>http://www.grok-interactive.com/blog/save-me-not/</link>
      <description>Buttons just begged to be pushed. We design them that way. But what if they do not need to be pushed? A while back I hit a project requirement that a form for user data could not be submitted back to the server unless there had been a change. I did *way* more work (and made the browser do way more work) than necessary.</description>

      <title>&quot;In Javascript everything is an object!&quot; Mmm, Wrong.</title>
      <link>http://www.grok-interactive.com/blog/javascript-everything-is-an-object-wrong/</link>
      <description>Most people will tell you that in javascript, everything is an object. That is not actually true, through the magic of auto-boxing javascript fools you into thinking it is an object. Quite a few of the things you use every day in javascript are actually primitives, not objects.</description>

      <title>Javascript dot notation versus bracket notation</title>
      <link>http://www.grok-interactive.com/blog/javascript-dot-notation-vs-bracket-notation/</link>
      <description>Javascript is one of those fun and unique languages that let you do things differently, just because. An example of this is the javascript object model. An object in javascript is simply a hashmap of key-value pairs where the key is always a string and the value can be anything.</description>

      <description>This may seem like a no-brainer but when creating a new web application you should be conscious of and avoid obvious avenues of attack... I said it was a no-brainer.</description>

      <title>Codeup for a Brighter Future</title>
      <link>http://www.grok-interactive.com/blog/codeup-for-a-brighter-future/</link>
      <description>Last fall Grok Interactive was needing to hire a developer and expand the team. We had read hundreds of resumes, most with little to no practical programming experience.  We quickly learned that many people wanted to be developers, but there were none to be found. The market was worse than we had realized.</description>
